  cluster-name:
    type: string
    description: Cluster name for the InnoDB cluster. Must be unique.
    default: jujuCluster
  table-open-cache:
    type: int
    default: 2048
    description:
      Sets table_open_cache (formerly known as table_cache) to mysql.
  max-connections:
    type: int
    default: 600
    description: |
      Maximum connections to allow. A value of -1 means use the server's
      compiled-in default. This is not typically that useful so the
      charm will configure PXC with a default max-connections value of 600.
      Note: Connections take up memory resources. Either at startup time with
      performance-schema=True or during run time with performance-schema=False.
      This value is a balance between connection exhaustion and memory
      exhaustion.
      .
      Consult a MySQL memory calculator like http://www.mysqlcalculator.com/ to
      understand memory resources consumed by connections.
      See also performance-schema.

    type: string
    default: "1000"
    description: |
